# Thingvellir 3D–VR

This repository contains the source code for a research-based 3D and VR experience
exploring how the acoustics of Thingvellir may have influenced its historical assemblies,
oral traditions, and social organization.

The project investigates the relationship between landscape, sound propagation,
and speech intelligibility at the Alþing assembly site, combining spatial audio,
3D environments, and interactive navigation.

## Online version

The experience is publicly accessible at:  
https://acousticheritagecollective.org/thingvellir/3d-vr/

## About the project

Thingvellir National Park is a unique natural amphitheater where the Icelandic Alþing
was established around the year 930. This project explores how the site’s topography
may have supported oral communication and collective listening practices in a
pre-literate society.

The work is part of an ongoing artistic and acoustic research project developed by
The Acoustic Heritage Collective.

## How to Play

The Thingvellir 3D–VR experience can be accessed either through a desktop web browser
or using a VR headset. Interaction and controls differ slightly depending on the mode.

### Desktop (Web Browser)

- The player is controlled using the **keyboard arrow keys**.
- Use the **arrow keys** to move forward, backward, and rotate within the environment.
- Press **ESC** to pause the experience.

For the best experience, the use of **headphones** is recommended.

### VR Mode

- Make sure that the **system audio output is assigned to the VR headset** before launching the experience.
- The player moves using the **joystick / thumbstick on the VR controllers**.
- Movement and orientation are controlled through the headset and controllers, allowing for immersive navigation of the environment.

For optimal spatial audio perception, ensure that the VR headset is properly fitted and calibrated.
